# SkyZe Requirements Elicitation

Hi all, given I'm in the middle of developing crypto trading and analytic tools and algo bots ... I'm wondering what tool or feature or technology is missing that you need to do your thing with crypto's? (and of course mainstream markets). Anything tht comes up I'll add to my list of features and it may even get developed! The project is called SykZe and is open source

Mike The thing I value most with bot/algo trading is SaaS model, I hate having to dick around running python bots and so on my laptop or a server somewhere.

@JaredDevo yup just setting up the deploy to Google Cloud Services .... will be SaaS

given the 24 hour nature of the markets can only be a cloud based SaaS

Mike Ive been using cryptotrader.org which is worth having a look around - its a bit of a basket case website but I do like the marketplace for different bots.

Mike New, [Oct 11, 2017, 10:00:34 AM]:
Thanks @JaredDevo  ... will do - I've looked at a few ... most have some great featrues and some holes for how I play ...

Also please think out side the box .... e.g. We've plans to do Machine Learning and Natural Langauge Processing to do sentiment and fundamental analysis - that can then feed into bots, screeners or info services

Mike Im not sure who your target market will be but AlgoTrader is a bit too intimidating for me.  I had a look at HaaSbot as well but didnt end up trying it out.

Mike That would be amazing if you can make that work - perhaps partner with existing sentiment providers like SAN - im sure its a very specialised area.

Making sense of so much unstructured data like streams and streams of reddit posts and twitter flame wars about Segwit2X

Mike New, [Oct 11, 2017, 10:07:50 AM]:
Right now ... target market is me !!!  Get something workign that supports how I work - from what I've seen that will produce a product that is highly competitive to everything else Iv'e seen .... and I'm also looking braoder and defining the target market ... at the moment we support people with skills only ... next step is to add a simple to use GUI so non progremmers can build stuff ... may even just do an info services website  .... I'm open to anything right now - that's why I'm asking what you need

@JaredDevo Great idea on the unstructured data and even blockchain level analysis could be interesting ...

Mike yeah I suspect integrating with a service like https://santiment.net/ is going to be standard - Dean and I suspect Bitfinex is looking at this
